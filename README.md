# gRPCtoJAXRS_archetype

The [RESTEasy grpc-bridge facility](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy) [UPDATE URL]
supports exposing Jakarta RESTful Web Services resources to gRPC clients. See the 
[RESTEasy User Guide](https://resteasy.dev/docs/) for a more detailed
discussion of the various mechanisms and classes involved.

There are a number of pieces to create, and this maven archetype includes a pom.xml which 
incorporates the steps necessary to create them.

## Using the archetype

gRPCtoJAXRS_archetype takes the GAV of an existing Jakarta RESTful Web Services project, called the **target project**,
and creates a new project which can generate a WAR with all of the pieces needed to interface between a gRPC client 
and the target project. We will refer to the generated project as the corresponding
**gRPCtoJkRWS project**.

To create a gRPCtoJkRWS project from an existing project, the archetype needs several 
pieces of information:

 1. the GAV of the target project

 2. the intended GAV of the gRPCtoJkRWS project

 3. "generate-package" parameter: the Java package to use for generated classes

 4. "resteasy-version" parameter

For example,

        mvn archetype:generate \
          -DarchetypeGroupId=org.jboss.resteasy -DarchetypeArtifactId=gRPCtoJAXRS-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
          -DgroupId=jaxrs.example -DartifactId=jaxrs.example -Dversion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
          -Dpackage=org.jboss.resteasy.example -Droot-class=CC1

See [jaxrs.example:jaxrs.example:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/ronsigal/jaxrs-example) 
for the sample code mentioned here.

The result is a new gRPCtoJkRWS maven project named by its artifactId. Its initial contents are

 1. pom.xml
 
 2. src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
 
 3. a Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource class named <root.class>_Server
 
 4. a template for a Jakarta RESTful Web Services test client named <root.class>_Client
 
Building the gRPCtoJkRWS project downloads the src/main/java contents of the target 
project, and builds all of the generated classes described in 
[RESTEasy grpc provider](https://github.com/ronsigal/Resteasy/tree/protobuf3/providers/resteasy-protobuf-provider).

The following parameters are needed:

 1. resteasy.version
 
 2. servlet.name [elaborate here]
 
 3. "root-class" parameter: the prefix to use for generated classes [Bad name: change to "root"]

For example,

        mvn -Dresteasy.version=4.7.0.Final -Dservlet.name=org.jboss.resteasy.example.ExampleApp -Droot.class=CC1 clean install
    
The gRPCtoJkRWS project will be populated as follows

 1. src/main/java will be copied from the target project
 
 2. src/main/proto will hold the <root.class>.proto file
 
 3. src/main/webapp/WEB-INF will hold web.xml
 
 4. src/test/java will hold test.grpc.<root.class>_Client.java and test.grpc.<root.class>_Server.java
 
 5. target/generated-sources/protobuf/java will hold <root.class>_proto.java, compiled 
    from <root.class>.proto
    
 6. target/generated-sources/protobuf/grpc-java will hold the following generated classes:
 
    A. `<root.class>ServiceGrpc.java` (generated by the proto compiler gRPC plugin)
    
    B. `<root.class>ServiceGrpcImpl.java` (generated by `org.jboss.resteasy.grpc.JaxrsImplBaseExtender`)
    
    C. `<root.class>_JavabufTranslator.java` (generated by `org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.protobuf.JavabufTranslatorGenerator`)
    
    D. `<root.class>MessageBodyReaderWriter.java` (generated by `org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.protobuf.ReaderWriterGenerator`)
    
The principal output is a WAR in the target directory which can be deployed to WildFly.

## Using the Web Archive

The class ${root-class}_Server is a Jakarta RESTful Web Services resource that can start up a gRPC server 
by calling

        http://localhost:8080/jaxrs.example.grpc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/root/grpcserver/start
        
Once the gRPC server is started, the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resources in the target project can be 
invoked by an appropriate gRPC client. The class ${root-class}_Client is a JUnit test
class with a number of tests. 

 1. There are some hard coded tests like `testInt()` and `testInteger()` that verify 
    that basic types are handled correctly.
    
 2. There is also a template method, commented out, that indicates how to test the 
    specific methods of the Jakarta RESTful Web Services resources. The appropriate javabuf objects need to be
    created and passed to the appropriate gRPC client stub method. Then the result 
    needs to be verified.

## To Do

gRPCtoJAXRS_archetype is a work in progress. More needs to be done, including:

 1. Additional primitive and wrapper tests
 
 2. More testing.
 
 3. Probably lots of other stuff.
